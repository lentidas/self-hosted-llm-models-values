# self-hosted-llm-models-values

This folder contains the `values.yaml` for the applications I am deploying/testing in my personal environment on the cluster created by the code in [this repository](https://github.com/camptocamp/self-hosted-llm-models-tests/tree/main/terraform).

The Helm charts that these values configure are available [here](https://github.com/camptocamp/self-hosted-llm-models-charts).
